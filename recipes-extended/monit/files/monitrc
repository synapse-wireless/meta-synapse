# This is a very small template monitrc file - it shows how to ensure
# SnapConnect is always restarted.  For more on monit, see the monit
# manual 

#check process snapconnect with pidfile /var/run/snapconnect.pid
#  group snap
#  start program = "/etc/init.d/S999snap start"
#  stop program = "/etc/init.d/S999snap stop"
#  if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout
